## Prerequisites

To self-host OpenCI, you need to meet the following prerequisites:

- Mac with M1 chip or higher
- macOS 14.0 or higher

## Initial Setup

To self-host OpenCI, you need to install several tools.

### Tart

Tart is a tool for managing macOS VMs.

<CodeGroup>

  ```bash macOS
  brew install cirruslabs/cli/tart
  ```

</CodeGroup>

### Firebase CLI

OpenCI uses Firebase, so Firebase CLI installation is required.

<CodeGroup>

  ```bash macOS
  curl -sL https://firebase.tools | bash
  ```

</CodeGroup>

### OpenCI Runner

OpenCI Runner is a CLI to run OpenCI. Dart is required for installation.

<CodeGroup>

  ```bash macOS
  dart pub global activate openci_runner
  ```

  ```bash install Dart
  brew install dart-sdk
  ```

</CodeGroup>

### Download Base Image

OpenCI uses macOS 15.0 as the base image. This process takes considerable time.

<CodeGroup>

  ```bash macOS
tart pull ghcr.io/open-ci-io/sequoia:0.0.4
  ```

</CodeGroup>

## Firebase Configuration
OpenCI uses Firebase for backend services. Therefore, Firebase configuration is necessary.

### Create Firebase Project

Access the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) with any Google account and create a project.

### Firestore Setup

Firestore is used for build job registration. Please access Firestore and complete the provisioning.

### Firebase Functions Setup
OpenCI uses Firebase Functions. Firebase Functions requires Blaze plan (paid) registration. The cost is around a few dollars per month.

### Deploy Firebase Functions
Clone the OpenCI CLI repository.
<CodeGroup>

  ```bash macOS
  gh repo clone open-ci-io/openci
  ```

</CodeGroup>

Then, navigate to the firebase_functions directory and run the following command to deploy Firebase Functions.

<CodeGroup>

  ```bash macOS
  cd apps/firebase_functions/functions
  firebase deploy --only functions
  ```

</CodeGroup>

## GitHub App Configuration

OpenCI uses GitHub App to fetch build jobs.

### Create GitHub App

Access [Create GitHub App](https://github.com/settings/apps/new) and create a GitHub App.

Then, specify the gitHubAppFunction of Firebase Functions as the webhook URL for the GitHub App.

### Secret Configuration

Register the secrets used in Firebase Functions.

#### APP_ID

<CodeGroup>

  ```bash macOS
  firebase functions:config:set APP_ID
  ```

</CodeGroup>

#### GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET

<CodeGroup>

  ```bash macOS
  firebase functions:config:set GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET
  ```

</CodeGroup>

#### PRIVATE_KEY

<CodeGroup>

  ```bash macOS
  firebase functions:config:set PRIVATE_KEY
  ```

</CodeGroup>

### Create Firebase Service Account

Create a Firebase service account and place it as apps/openci_runner/firebase_service_account.json.

Now the self-hosting setup for OpenCI is complete. Great job!
