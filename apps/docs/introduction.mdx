## Prerequisites

To self-host OpenCI, you need to meet the following prerequisites:

- Mac with M1 or later
- macOS 14.0 or later

## Initial Setup

To self-host OpenCI, you need to install several tools.

### Tart

Tart is a tool for managing macOS VMs.

<CodeGroup>

  ```bash macOS
  brew install cirruslabs/cli/tart
  ```

</CodeGroup>

### Firebase CLI

OpenCI uses Firebase, so you need to install the Firebase CLI.

<CodeGroup>

  ```bash macOS
  curl -sL https://firebase.tools | bash
  ```

</CodeGroup>

### OpenCI Runner

OpenCI Runner is a CLI for running OpenCI. It requires Dart for installation.

<CodeGroup>

  ```bash macOS
  dart pub global activate openci_runner
  ```

  ```bash install Dart
  brew install dart-sdk
  ```

</CodeGroup>

### Download the Base Image

OpenCI uses macOS 15.0 as its base image. This will take a very long time.

<CodeGroup>

  ```bash macOS
tart pull ghcr.io/open-ci-io/sequoia:0.0.4
  ```

</CodeGroup>

## Firebase Configuration

OpenCI uses Firebase for its backend and other features. Therefore, Firebase needs to be configured.

### Create a Firebase Project

Access the [Firebase site](https://console.firebase.google.com/) with any Google account and create a project.

### Firestore Configuration

Firestore is used for registering build jobs. Access Firestore and perform provisioning.

### Firebase Functions Configuration

OpenCI uses Firebase Functions. Using Firebase Functions requires registering for the Blaze plan (paid). The cost is a few yen per month.

### Firebase Initialization

After creating a Firebase project, specify the project to use.

<CodeGroup>

  ```bash macOS
  firebase use project-id
  ```

</CodeGroup>

### Deploy Firebase Functions

Clone the OpenCI CLI repository.
<CodeGroup>

  ```bash macOS
  gh repo clone open-ci-io/openci
  ```

</CodeGroup>

Then, navigate to the firebase_functions directory and execute the following command to deploy Firebase Functions.

<CodeGroup>

  ```bash macOS
  cd apps/firebase_functions/functions
  firebase deploy --only functions
  ```

</CodeGroup>

## GitHub App Configuration

OpenCI uses a GitHub app to retrieve build jobs.

### Create a GitHub App

Access [Create a GitHub App](https://github.com/settings/apps/new) and create a GitHub app.

Then, set the webhook URL of the GitHub app to the gitHubAppFunction of Firebase Functions.

### Configure Secrets

Register the secrets used by Firebase Functions.

#### APP_ID

<CodeGroup>

  ```bash macOS
  firebase functions:config:set APP_ID
  ```

</CodeGroup>

#### GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET

<CodeGroup>

  ```bash macOS
  firebase functions:config:set GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET
  ```

</CodeGroup>

#### PRIVATE_KEY

<CodeGroup>

  ```bash macOS
  firebase functions:config:set PRIVATE_KEY
  ```

</CodeGroup>

### Create a Firebase Service Account

Create a Firebase service account and place it as apps/openci_runner/firebase_service_account.json.

With this, the preparation for self-hosting OpenCI is complete. Congratulations!
```
