To run OpenCI, execute the following command:

The required files are the GitHub Apps Private Key `.pem` file and the Firebase service account `.json` file that you created on the previous page.

You will also need your Firebase project ID.

<CodeGroup>

  ```bash macOS
  openci_runner runner --pem-path path-to-pem-file \
    --service-account-path path-to-service-account-json-file \
    --project-id project-id
  ```

</CodeGroup>

Running this command will start the OpenCI Runner.
