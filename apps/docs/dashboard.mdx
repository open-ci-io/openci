The OpenCI Dashboard allows you to perform various OpenCI operations. Currently, it only supports macOS.

## GoogleService-Info.plist Configuration

The OpenCI Dashboard uses GoogleService-Info.plist for Firebase authentication.

Add a macOS app to your Firebase project. The bundle ID is `io.openci.dashboard.ios`.

After adding the macOS app, download the GoogleService-Info.plist file.

## Launching the Dashboard

Download the Dashboard.dmg file from https://github.com/open-ci-io/openci.

Open the downloaded Dashboard.dmg file to launch the OpenCI Dashboard.

## Configuring the Dashboard

After launching the OpenCI Dashboard, configure the GoogleService-Info.plist.

## Firebase Configuration

OpenCI uses Firestore and Firebase Auth. Provision Firestore and enable email address sign-in in Firebase Auth.

After that, you will be able to create an account.
